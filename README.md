# Lightning talk topic:
🌶️🌶️🌶️ ***Write a HTTP server that is fully featured enough to respond to requests from your web browser and have them displayed. For this you will need to understand the HTTP protocol, how to parse HTTP requests, and how to send responses.***

```
Welcome to my lightning talk.
As an exercise i decided to breakdown
abstraction we encountered before - HTTP server.

Web frameworks abstract us from parsing incoming web request 
(it's 
essentially just a string) and building corresponsding HTTP response.

Please follow steps I created
to help Us understand how to build HTTP server
from scract using socket library.

Please don't treat it as fully functional server 
- it's created for purely educational purposes :)
 showes basic functionality 
and I'm planning to expand it in the future 
(for example: To handle all requests, errors,
and work with templates) 
  as it is interesting topic.
